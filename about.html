		<p>sula.tats is run and owned by Ursula and has been for 3 years. Ursula always had a passion for tattoo and art growing up and knew they wanted to become a tattoo artist once they were old enough. They started off as an apprentice at a shop here in Portland and had a residency there for several years. In 2019 they decided to open their own private studio and start working with their own clients. 
		</p>
		<p>Stylistically Ursula has always been drawn to nature, animals, and the female figure. Many of their illustrations and tattoos so imagery of these themes. The lower half of a figure with the top of a mushroom is a popular image in their designs. Ursulaâ€™s style consists of thin detailed line work void of any color or shading they let the delicate lines and detail shine through.
		</p>
		<p>Interested customers can request flash designs and designs are not repeated, if the design is already claimed alterations can be made so every person leaves with their own unique art piece!
